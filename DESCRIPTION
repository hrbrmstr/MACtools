Description: A media access control address ('MAC' address) of a device is a unique 
   identifier assigned to a network interface controller ('NIC') for communications at 
   the data link layer of a network segment. 'MAC' addresses are used as a network 
   address for most 'IEEE' 802 network technologies, including 'Ethernet' and 'Wi-Fi'. In 
   this context, 'MAC' addresses are used in the medium access control protocol sublayer.
   Tools are provided to work with these 'MAC' addresses.
